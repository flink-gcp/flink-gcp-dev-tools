description: Squash a pull request's branch to one commit and push it without silently reverting work that landed on main meanwhile. Use before EVERY push of a PR branch — the first one, each review round's fix-ups, and the final push before calling the PR ready — and whenever about to run `git push`, `git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, `git reset --soft`, or "squash the commits". Mandatory when `origin/main` may have moved since the branch was created, which on this repository it usually has.

# Push a PR branch

This procedure is restored from [the connector skill at `02c4bd59`](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/blob/02c4bd594d2b774cc24b0c0194c1834dd5032120/.agents/skills/push-pr-branch/SKILL.md).
The incidents and measurements below are historical connector evidence, not observations about the consuming project.
Before using the procedure, read the consuming repository's `AGENTS.md` and the development guidance it names for repository identity, verification commands, supported versions, and authorization boundaries.
Keep the procedure and its decision conditions shared; bind only those repository-specific inputs locally.
Current review records described below as PR comments use inline comments on reviewed diff lines, an empty review body, and the GitHub review API `comments` array.

The operation this repository asks for on every PR — one commit, squashed, force-pushed — has a
failure mode that nothing downstream reports. This skill is the procedure that avoids it.

## What goes wrong

`git reset --soft origin/main` followed by `git commit` builds a commit whose **parent is main's
tip** but whose **tree is the branch's older one**. Everything main gained since the branch started
is then *deleted* by that commit. It is a well-formed, internally consistent revert of other
people's merged work, wearing your change's commit message.

Three properties make it invisible, all measured on PR [#376](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/376) (2026-08-08; [connector ADR-0069](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/blob/02c4bd594d2b774cc24b0c0194c1834dd5032120/docs/adr/0069-a-pr-branch-is-rebased-before-it-is-squashed.md)):

- **CI passes.** Reverting a feature deletes its tests along with its code, so nothing fails to
  compile and no test is left referencing anything missing. That PR was 14/14 green while deleting
  an ADR, two connector source files, two test files and two skills.
- **Branch protection cannot see it.** "Require branches to be up to date" asserts *ancestry* — is
  main's tip an ancestor of the head? — and the corrupted commit's parent **was** the merge commit
  of the PR it reverted. The setting was satisfied by the very commit that undid the work.
- **"Update branch" cements it.** Merging main back in leaves the deletions in place: main has not
  touched those files since the merge base, your side deleted them, and the deletion wins. The
  button a reader reaches for as the fix makes the revert permanent.

So the only place to catch it is here, before the push.

## The procedure

```bash
git fetch origin                                    # 1. always, first
git rebase origin/main                              # 2. bring the branch up to date, resolving
                                                    #    conflicts; NEVER skip to step 3 instead
git reset --soft origin/main                        # 3. safe only after 2 — see below
git commit -F <message-file>                        # 4. one commit, WHAT/WHY per the template
git push --force-with-lease                         # 5. after the gate, never before
```

Step 2 is the whole point, and the reason is precise rather than slogan-shaped. `reset --soft` sets
HEAD to the named commit while keeping the tree, so it is a squash either way — what changes is
*what the new commit's tree is measured against*. On a branch that has not been rebased, that
parent is a `origin/main` the tree has never seen, and everything main gained becomes a deletion.
After a rebase, `origin/main` and the branch's merge base are the same commit, so the squash
measures against what the branch actually started from. If a rebase is genuinely unwanted, the
equivalent safe form is `git reset --soft $(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)`, which is immune to
main moving — but prefer the rebase, because a stale branch has to be brought forward before merge
anyway.

Two habits defeat step 2 without saying so, both measured on 2026-08-17 while writing this section.
`git rebase` refuses on any dirty worktree, staged or not — "cannot rebase: You have unstaged
changes" — so the branch's own edits must be committed, or stashed, before step 2 rather than
staged into it. And a failed rebase must stop the chain: `git rebase … ; git reset --soft …`
runs the reset anyway, and `git rebase … | tail -1 && …` is worse, because the pipeline's status
is `tail`'s success. Chain
the steps with `&&`, never with `;` or through a pipe. Getting this wrong produced exactly the
corruption at the top of this page: the squash landed on a moved `origin/main` and the commit
deleted 660 lines of another PR's merged tests, which only the gate's diffstat caught.

Step 4 takes a message file because the WHAT/WHY belongs in the commit, not only in the PR body;
write it first. Step 5 needs `--force-with-lease` because steps 3-4 rewrite history the remote
already has — and note that step 1's `git fetch` updates the remote-tracking ref, which is what
`--force-with-lease` compares against, so on a branch someone else might also push to, run the
gate and the push together rather than fetching again in between.

## The gate, before every push

Three commands. All three, every time, including on a push you are sure about.

```bash
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD                 # exactly one line
git diff --diff-filter=D --name-only origin/main    # empty, or every path deliberate
git diff --stat origin/main | tail -1               # file count matches what you touched
```

**Run them only after the rebase, never instead of it.** On a branch that is behind,
`git diff origin/main` reports upstream work the branch simply has not picked up yet as
*deletions* — indistinguishable, at a glance, from the corruption this skill exists to catch. That
is a false positive with the same shape as the true one, and reading it as either without rebasing
first is a coin flip. If a rebase is genuinely impossible right now, compare against
`$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)` instead, which answers the question the gate is actually
asking: what does *this branch* change?

A fourth, once the pull request exists, because the three above cannot see it:

```bash
gh pr view <n> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus     # MERGEABLE, or resolve before reporting green
```

`CONFLICTING` means GitHub runs no further checks, so a "CI is green" already recorded in a review
comment stays in the record looking current while nothing re-ran against the moved base. The three
commands above compare the branch against `origin/main` and would not catch it: the branch can be
current at squash time and the conflict arrive afterwards. Measured on [#1014](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/1014), where `main` moved and
the conflict was in `docs/adr/README.md`, one row beneath the row the change edited.

`mergeable` is computed asynchronously, so a push is often followed by `UNKNOWN` for a few seconds.
**Treat `UNKNOWN` as "ask again", never as a pass** — a check that green-lights its own unanswered
state is worse than no check.

When it comes back conflicting, use the conflict-only fast path below only when its completed-review
preconditions hold. Otherwise follow the ordinary fetch/rebase procedure, run the affected checks,
and complete the initial review flow. Do not carry an exact-tree test result over a changed
resolution, but do not rebuild unchanged upstream work locally either. The pull request's merge-ref
CI owns the build-integration check.

The second of the three is the one that matters most, and it is **a list to read rather than a
number to interpret**.
On [#376](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/376) the diffstat *was* read at each push and the deletions hid inside a plausible-looking
insertion count; only the explicit list makes them impossible to miss. If any path in it is one you
did not intend to remove, stop — do not push, do not "just re-run the squash".

A push may proceed when the deletion list is empty, or when every path in it is a file this change
genuinely removes and the commit message says so.

## Conflict-only refresh fast path

Use this only to absorb a moved `main`, with no authored fix-up. The latest round-one, round-two,
and independent-review comments must name the same full HEAD SHA. If any record is missing or names
a different HEAD SHA, use the ordinary procedure and review loop.

Compare those three comments manually, then paste their agreed HEAD SHA — not the recorded base —
into `reviewed_head`; the block cannot read PR comments. These are Bash blocks: from fish, enter
`bash` first. Fetch once, then copy the four full SHAs printed below into the PR refresh note as
literal `<old-head>`, `<old-base>`, `<new-base>`, and `<pushed-head>` values. Do not use mutable
remote-tracking names in later comparisons:

```bash
reviewed_head=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 # replace with the recorded SHA
git fetch origin || exit 1
status_output=$(git status --short) || exit 1
old_head=$(git rev-parse HEAD) || exit 1
new_base=$(git rev-parse origin/main) || exit 1
old_base=$(git merge-base "$old_head" "$new_base") || exit 1
pushed_head=$(git rev-parse '@{upstream}') || exit 1
test -z "$status_output" || exit 1
test "$old_head" = "$pushed_head" || exit 1
test "$old_head" = "$reviewed_head" || exit 1
printf 'old-head=%s\nold-base=%s\nnew-base=%s\npushed-head=%s\n' \
  "$old_head" "$old_base" "$new_base" "$pushed_head"
```

The block verifies that status is empty and `<old-head>`, `<pushed-head>`, and the manually agreed
`reviewed_head` are identical. The preceding manual comparison establishes the three-comment
precondition.

Use only those literal SHAs to inspect the upstream delta and rebase:

```bash
git log --oneline <old-base>..<new-base> || exit 1
git diff --name-only <old-base>..<new-base> || exit 1
git diff --name-only <old-base>..<old-head> || exit 1
git rebase <new-base>
```

If rebase stops, run `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U` before resolving and record every path.
After the rebase, compare the complete patch and path inventory without carrying shell state:

```bash
git range-diff <old-base>..<old-head> <new-base>..HEAD || exit 1
old_paths=$(git diff --name-only <old-base>..<old-head>) || exit 1
new_paths=$(git diff --name-only <new-base>..HEAD) || exit 1
if [ "$old_paths" != "$new_paths" ]; then
  printf 'old paths:\n%s\nnew paths:\n%s\n' "$old_paths" "$new_paths" >&2
  exit 1
fi
git diff --diff-filter=D --name-only <new-base>..HEAD || exit 1
```

For each recorded conflict path, repeat `git range-diff` with `-- <path>` and fail if it cannot run.
Inspect any upstream commit that touches a PR-owned path or a source on which its behavior, tests,
public contracts, or factual claims depend.

- If the complete patch, path inventory, and those dependencies are unchanged, retain completed
  reviews. Run only checks owed by resolved paths, push through the ordinary gate, and wait for
  current PR merge-ref CI.
- If a resolution changes behavior, a test or public contract, or a factual claim, it is an
  authored fix-up. Run affected checks and use the bounded fix-up review defined by the review
  skills.

Do not rerun the consuming repository's full verification merely because the rebase brought already-validated commits from `main`.
A Markdown conflict gets its documentation checker, a Java conflict gets its affected test or
module, and a build-input conflict may require the full build. Compatibility-sensitive work still
runs the consuming repository's required local compatibility checks for versions its per-PR CI does not cover.
The original connector command is `just verify-flink 1.20.4`; at that source revision, its per-PR CI does not cover that version.

## The fourth check, once the pull request exists

The gate above protects the tree. One thing it cannot see is whether the pull request will close
the issue it was written for, and that is the other thing this repository asks of every PR:
The workflow requires an **unformatted** closing keyword for the assigned issue.
Two spellings satisfy that rule and the repository's other one, that a bare `#N` does not autolink
in a PR body: `Closes https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>/issues/N` (PRs [#792](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/792) and
[#794](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/794)) and `Closes [#N](https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>/issues/N).` (PR [#770](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/770)). A
closing keyword inside a code span does not parse at all.

The check runs immediately after `gh pr create` — there is no PR to ask about before that, so it
is not part of the gate above — and again after any push that rewrites the body. Resolve `<owner>` and
`<repository>` with `gh repo view --json owner,name`, substitute the current PR number for `N`, and ask GitHub rather
than reading the body:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{repository(owner:"<owner>",name:"<repository>"){
  pullRequest(number:N){closingIssuesReferences(first:5){nodes{number title}}}}}'
```

An empty array means the issue survives the merge and nothing reports it; a list naming an issue
this PR must *not* close means a closing verb was parsed out of ordinary prose. [#361](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/361)'s timeline
records exactly that, closed by PR [#389](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/389), whose body no longer carries the sentence [the original connector guide](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/blob/02c4bd594d2b774cc24b0c0194c1834dd5032120/.agents/references/repository-guide.md) quotes.

This check is here rather than in either self-review round because by review time the body is
already written, and because the failure is silent from every direction: the merge succeeds, CI is
green, and the issue is simply still open. Three merged passes of this repository's coverage-audit
series carried no closing reference — [#772](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/772), [#774](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/774) and [#791](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/791) — so issues [#784](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/784), [#785](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/785) and [#788](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/788) each
had to be closed by hand. They are not consecutive: [#790](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/790), between the second and the third, carried
one and closed [#785](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/785) on merge, which is what makes the omission easy to miss by eye.

## Recovery, when the gate fails

Rebuilding beats untangling. A rebase whose conflicts are all in files you never touched is a
signal to start over, not to resolve.

The recovery below resets the worktree and is destructive. Before running it, resolve the exact
branch and owned-file list with read-only commands, preserve the current commit on the backup
branch, and obtain the user's explicit approval for the hard reset. Never substitute an unresolved
variable, glob, repository root, or home directory for the targets shown here.

```bash
BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main)             # what this branch actually started from

# Confirm none of your files also moved upstream, or the checkout below would
# revert *that*. Expect no output. (bash; under fish use `(… | psub)` for `<(…)`.)
comm -12 <(git diff --name-only "$BASE" origin/main | sort) \
         <(git diff --name-only "$BASE" HEAD | sort)

git branch -f "backup/$(git branch --show-current)" HEAD    # nothing is lost
git reset --hard origin/main
git checkout "backup/$(git branch --show-current)" -- <the files this change owns>
git commit -F <message-file>                        # the rebuild is not done until it is a commit
```

The result is auditable by construction: the branch can only contain what was named. The backup
branch is named after the one it saves, because this repository runs one worktree per PR and a
fixed `backup` cannot be forced while it is checked out in another.

If the corrupted commit was already pushed, this is still the fix — force-push the rebuilt branch
and say plainly in a PR comment what was reverted and restored, because a reviewer who read the
earlier diff read a wrong one.

## Why this is a skill and not a checker

A content-only check cannot tell this apart from an intentional deletion: on [#376](https://github.com/flink-gcp/flink-connector-gcp/issues/376) the deleted files
existed at the merge base, exactly as they would if the author had meant to remove them. The intent
lives in the author's head at squash time, which is where this procedure runs. A CI check would
need that intent restated as an allowlist or a declaration, for a defect whose real cure is not
using `reset --soft` on a moving ref.

whose fix-up commits are the most common reason a branch is squashed a second time.
